# Challenges

In this repo I'll post some of the challenges I've done in the past, mostly for job applications. They're not necessarily the end result or the best result but are just a possible solution. If you would've done something different or better, please make a PR and I'll include it as an alternative solution so that other people can benefit from this exercise, not for their job search, because I won't identify the companies and because that's not my purpose. You should learn, not copy because that is what will you take you far in life.
