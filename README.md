# Challenges

In this repo I'll post some of the challenges I've done in the past, mostly for job applications. They're not necessarily the end result but some work might be done posteriorly. If you would've done something different, please make a PR and I'll include it as an alternative solution so that other people can benefit from this exercise, not for their job search because I won't identify the companies and because that's not my purpose. You should learn, not copy because that you take you far in life.
